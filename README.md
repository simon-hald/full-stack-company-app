### This is a title i made
Here goes relevant text

## Intro
* This project is made with express-generator-typescript - a npx packafe that builds nodejs+express apps with typescript setup build in.
* Normally .env files should not be in the git repo, but for ease of use, they are in this case (backend/src/pre-start/env)
* The assignment PDF (Full Stack Application Assignemnt.pdf) is located in root of this project.
* This project includes both frontend and backend. 
  * They build individually, but the backend build will copy everything from the generated frontend/dist/frontend folder to its own dist/public fodler

## Frontend

# Backlog

[ ] FE - link user to company \
[ ] document API \
[ ] FE - make a table component, which can be shard between owner and company component \
[ ] FE - fix duplicate code between user and company modules \
[ ] FE - "prettyOwnerName()" in company.component is not a great solution! \
[ ] FE - UserModelFull is redundant, do like with CompanyModel \
[ ] FE - put the url used for endpoint in env.
